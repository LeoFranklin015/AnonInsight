# AnonInsight Dashboard

AnonInsight Dashboard is a web application designed for zk-feedback creators to manage and generate circuits for their feedback forms. The dashboard allows users to provide a regex pattern and the Sindri API key, which is used to dynamically generate circuits using zk-email regex. Sindri is then utilized to automate the deployment of the circuit in the architecture. The dashboard returns the form ID and circuit ID, which can be further used for creating zk-feedback forms and viewing anonymous feedbacks.

## Features

- **Circuit Management**: Generate and manage circuits for zk-feedback forms.
- **Dynamic Circuit Generation**: Utilize regex patterns to dynamically generate circuits.
- **Sindri Integration**: Automate circuit deployment using Sindri service.
- **Form ID and Circuit ID Retrieval**: Obtain form ID and circuit ID for creating feedback forms.
