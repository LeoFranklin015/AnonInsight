# Anon Insight 
  Introducing our innovative project, designed to revolutionize feedback collection: An Anonymous Feedback Platform with domain verification. Seamlessly integrating Bandada, Semaphore, and Proof of Email, our versatile tool ensures that only verified email domains can provide anonymous feedback. In the backend, we leverage Zk-email regex functionality, powered by the Sindri API key, to dynamically generate circuits based on provided patterns. With automated Sindri deployment, circuit IDs are returned to the admin dashboard, facilitating easy form creation using our SDK."
